# Welcome to Website Tennis!

This project was inspired by [Layer Tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoshop_contest#Photoshop_tennis). The idea is that members of the 2017 MHCC Code Academy class will take turns making incremental changes to the website in this repository. An random order will be established and we'll keep track of the changes people make on Slack.

Here are the rules:

- When it's your turn you must make one change to either the HTML, JavaScript or CSS that make-up the site. You can make changes to all three if desired.

- Changes cannott be entirely subtractive! You **can** undo someone's change so long as you add something new in its place. For example: if someone adds an image to the site you can remove it, but you should add new content in its place.

- Adding new files is entirely permitted but deleting them entirely is not. As mentioned before, you can chnge the content within them freely.

- You are encouraged to try bold, new and experimental things! This site should serve as a playground to try what we've learned in class and practice collaborating with others, in a light-hearted way.
